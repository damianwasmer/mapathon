          <h4>But what is Mapathon? </h4>

          <p>Mapathon is a project developed in ReactJS that allows the user to save his POIs (points of interest) and display them on a map.
            These can have categories, tags and contain several parameters such as a title, a description, access to their website if they have one, etc.</p>

          <p>Thus, once added, they can of course be edited.</p>
